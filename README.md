# GoProjectSkeleton

## Introduction

**GoProjectSkeleton** is a simple Go project skeleton that provides a basic structure for building Go applications. It is a **Clean Architecture** project that follows the principles of separation of concerns and modularity. The project is designed to be easily extensible and maintainable, making it a great starting point for your Go projects. this templated is based **OOP Template Project** for Go to implement with any **Web server framework** or even any user interface.

The main philosophy of **GoProjectSkeleton** is that your solution **domain** and **application** (business logic) should be independent of the **infrastructure** (frameworks, libraries, etc.). This allows you to easily swap out different implementations of your infrastructure without affecting your core business logic.
**
The design of **GoProjectSkeleton** is based on the principles of **Clean Architecture** and **Hexagonal Architecture**, an architecture that allow us to decouple the business logic from dependencies, even without need to think about the type of **database**, **providers** or **services**, **frameworks**, **libraries** or any other dependencies.


This project is inspired by the work of **Higuita, Victor** [NodeTskeleton](https://github.com/harvic3/nodetskeleton).
